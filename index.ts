//called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message.
// Print your message.

let qoute: string= "A person who nevere made a mistake never tried anything new "
let famous_person= "Albert Einstein";
let message=`${famous_person} once said, ${qoute}`;

// Q6:Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning
//and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
//Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after 
//striping the white spaces.

let personName= "\n\t Mehwish Naz \t\n";
console.log(personName);
var stripped = personName.trim();
console.log(stripped);
