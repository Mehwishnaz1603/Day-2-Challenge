//like the following, including the quotation marks:

let quote: string = " A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new ";
let author: string = "Albert Einstein"
console.log(` ${author } once said, "${quote}`);

// Q5: Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famouspersonâ€™s name in a variable
//called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message.
// Print your message.

let qoute: string= "A person who nevere made a mistake never tried anything new "
let famous_person= "Albert Einstein";
let message=`${famous_person} once said, ${qoute}`;

// Q6:Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning
//and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
//Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after 
//striping the white spaces.

let personName= "\n\t Mehwish Naz \t\n";
console.log(personName);
var stripped = personName.trim();
console.log(stripped);
